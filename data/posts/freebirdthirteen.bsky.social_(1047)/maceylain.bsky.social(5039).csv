"maceylain.bsky.social","About half of all algal species do require B12 for growth, because they depend on B12-based enzymes for essential metabolic reactions. The other half do not need it at all, yet still accumulate it. In both cases, B12 comes from symbiotic or nearby bacteria, not from the algae themselves.","2025-10-25T17:29:55.441Z"
"maceylain.bsky.social","Here is a question: are algae more like plants, simply absorbing B12 from the environment? Or do they actually require B12 like animals?","2025-10-25T17:29:55.440Z"
"maceylain.bsky.social","How do we know it’s bioavailable? 🔎in B12-deficient rats, supplementing with dried purple laver restored B12 status 🔎vegan children who consumed diets including brown rice and dried purple laver did not develop B12 deficiency","2025-10-25T17:29:55.439Z"
"maceylain.bsky.social","There is another non-animal B12 source: algae. Certain edible macroalgae, such as dried purple laver (nori), can contain substantial amounts of bioactive B12.","2025-10-25T17:29:55.438Z"
"maceylain.bsky.social","🦠because bacteria in fermented foods, such as certain beans and vegetables, use plant material for energy and produce B12 as a byproduct ❕However, while fermented foods can contain B12, the amounts are unpredictable, so they are not considered a reliable source of this vitamin for humans.","2025-10-25T17:29:55.437Z"
"maceylain.bsky.social","🦠because B12-producing bacteria may reside on or in the plant (think soil microbes and unwashed vegetables). This was likely one way our ancestors got some B12, not something wildly practiced in the modern world.","2025-10-25T17:29:55.436Z"

"maceylain.bsky.social","❔First of all, let’s understand why meat like beef has substantial amounts of B12. Cows, like humans, need B12 to live and function, but they also cannot synthesize it. So how do they get it? ⚪cows eat food that introduces B12-producing bacteria into the rumen, where they act as B12 factories","2025-10-25T17:29:55.434Z"
"maceylain.bsky.social","🧪🍎📃 Vitamin B12 is a rather unique vitamin. Only certain bacteria and archaea can make it, not plants or animals. Animals require B12 and can obtain and store it, which is why meat and fish are well-known sources for humans. But what about non-animal foods? Can they provide any B12 at all?🧵⤵️","2025-10-25T17:29:55.433Z"
