"arniemi.bsky.social","@arimelber.bsky.social Today you spent a lot of time covering Trump's Pardoning of the January 6 criminals. This is a real attack on the rule of law. What about protesters against Trump? Maybe the protesters are attacked. The police arrest attackers for violent acts. Will Trump pardon them?","2025-01-21T23:27:32.649Z"
