The survivors are still fighting for transparency. And so am I. We aren’t finished yet","2025-11-03T14:22:12.881Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","So for anyone keeping track, we now have: -King of the United Kingdom is forced to act against his own brother. - U.S. president defending the monarchy while facing Epstein-related scrutiny himself.","2025-11-03T14:22:12.880Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","Earlier this year, activists projected images of Trump and Epstein onto Windsor Castle during his state visit. Four people were arrested.","2025-11-03T14:22:12.879Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","Trump isn’t outside the story. Democrats recently resurfaced a 2003 birthday message to Epstein signed “Donald,” found in Epstein’s leather-bound birthday book.

"arcordray.bsky.social","Why now? The pressure. The royals have long known about the allegations from Virginia Giuffre about Andrew. They knew a young woman claimed he had sexually abused her and that she was trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell.","2025-11-03T14:22:12.873Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","His comments came just days after King Charles took decisive action and stripped Andrew of his royal title and removed him from official royal duties.","2025-11-03T14:22:12.872Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","“It’s a terrible thing that’s happened to the family… I feel badly for them.” President Donald Trump expressed sympathy not for survivors and victims of Epstein, but for King Charles and the British royal family as they try to contain the fallout from Andrew’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein.

"arcordray.bsky.social","Virginia also explicitly wrote: she had no way of knowing if it was actually true — “Whether that was true or not, we’ll never know.” So it’s a claim Maxwell allegedly made more than once and not a confirmed fact.

"arcordray.bsky.social","He has not yet responded. His titles were finally stripped. But it’s just a symbolic distraction of the injustice that remains. Survivors still wait. And justice for Virginia still waits.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.277Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","Fast forward to present day and U.S. lawmakers have been calling on Prince Andrew (now “Andrew Mountbatten Windsor”) to testify before Congress about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.276Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","U.S. prosecutors said Andrew refused to cooperate, even after Epstein died and the FBI publicly asked him to assist. The Palace said nothing. Accountability was optional. Reputation was the priority. Virginia was not even a thought.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.275Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","He kept his title, military honors, and royal protection. He never admitted or apologized to Virginia for what he did to her.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.274Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","It was only after Epstein’s arrest and Virginia Giuffre’s lawsuit, when public outrage grew—that the monarchy dole out any actions against him. He wasn’t investigated or charged criminally but was pushed from public duties.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.273Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","Meanwhile, Virginia remained steadfast in providing sworn depositions, flight logs, photos, and even then, still wasn’t believed.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.272Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","The first instinct wasn’t accountability, but instead damage control. Legal teams attacked Virginia’s credibility. Royal insiders briefed the press about her “bad memory” and “unreliable” testimony.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.271Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","And here we are, months after Virginia dies and weeks after her memoir drops-and there is finally a title removal.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.270Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","Even after her civil lawsuit was filed, Andrew went on BBC Newsnight and claimed he had “no recollection of ever meeting her.” He said her story was false. And? The Palace stood by him. They didn’t remove his title, military roles, or patronages until the backlash exploded publicly years later.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.269Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","There are still bot farms that attempt to smear her name anytime I post about this. Perhaps they are more concerned about protecting the institution than justice for survivors.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.268Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","When Virginia first accused Prince Andrew, the response wasn’t investigation. Instead, it was denial and victim character assassination. The Palace issued statements defending him. British tabloids smeared her endlessly, calling her “money-seeking” and “fantasist.”","2025-11-01T15:57:07.267Z"
"arcordray.bsky.social","Andrew kept his title through lawsuits, flight logs and settlements. Only after the Queen died—after Virginia died—and her memoir hit the world, did the Palace act. They knew. They waited. They chose silence over justice.","2025-11-01T15:57:07.266Z"
