"philbutta.bsky.social","One of the things that angers me most about the Trump era is that none of what he or his party are doing is deemed precedent. Meaning: if any future Democratic Congress or POTUS does even 0.1% of what Trumpism has done, you’ll be able to hear media and the GOP howling from Mars.

To watch Democrats stand by idle while hooligans defile our history, our sacrifices, and our dreams - where is hope? Better to remain an anonymous spectator.","2024-11-13T21:51:50.701Z"
