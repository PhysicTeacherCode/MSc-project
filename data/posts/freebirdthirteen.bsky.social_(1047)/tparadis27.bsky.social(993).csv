"tparadis27.bsky.social","As a Navy veteran, I asked some of my friends still serving what they thought about Trump's new Navy Secretary, a man with ZERO military experience of any type, but who was a huge Trump donor. The responses were massively along the line of """"WTF???"""" Yeah, I'm expecting a huge number of retirements.","2024-11-28T22:31:40.911Z"
"tparadis27.bsky.social","How the fuck can people use the wording """"We're imposing tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada""""? We're imposing them on OURSELVES. Why is this sooooooo difficult for people to understand?","2024-11-28T00:49:25.229Z"

There's NO comparison to be made.","2024-11-27T23:45:54.079Z"
"tparadis27.bsky.social","Trump 2.0 is going to be worse than anyone could imagine. One look at these cabinet picks and you can see that there won't be any """"adults in the room"""" to restrain his worst instincts. The best we can hope for is that some of these massive egos will clash and give us some epic infighting.","2024-11-27T23:38:34.194Z"
"tparadis27.bsky.social","When Republicans refuse to work with them in good faith, House Dems should fvck with them right back and add amendments to bills such as prohibiting anyone with nipples from using the Men’s room, or banning Arabic Numerals in public schools.

"tparadis27.bsky.social","Russian citizens have seen their purchasing power diminish by almost 30% over the past year. Wonder what the breaking point for them will be?

"tparadis27.bsky.social","Republicans have put forth a bill to force states to have FINAL election results within 12 hours of the polls closing.

"tparadis27.bsky.social","The Russian Ruble is now worth about 9/10ths of a penny. Most Russians make around 1500 Rubles a month. Gotta wonder when they don't just say """"fuck it"""" and rise up against their government. It's happened before.","2024-11-27T17:42:54.351Z"

"tparadis27.bsky.social","I think the ONLY reason Biden didn't replace Garland is that it would have appeared to be politically motivated, rather than a matter of Garland not doing his job.
