"toweather.bsky.social","Hey maga. You voted for trump. You voted for this. You pulled the trigger. You killed her. Blood on your hands that will never wash away.","2026-01-09T13:34:07.188Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Who else is feeling like Trump is going to start WW3 and I don't have a bunker?","2026-01-06T14:24:27.844Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","It would take a vile know-nothing self-serving mental case to bring us to WW3. Trump IS that vile know-nothing self-serving mental case.","2026-01-05T13:09:10.807Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","It's a painful reality that we have to endure another 3 years before we can actually mean Happy New Year.","2026-01-01T15:42:54.010Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","If we all take a moment today and look ourselves in the mirror, we'll see America in fact remains. Merry Christmas guys.","2025-12-25T17:58:09.843Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Hey guys, take a little break from the madness.. I'm out here rescuing a boat on Chesapeake Bay. Out here the world seems still real and unaffected. Dolphins know nothing of Trump. We should be so lucky..","2025-12-20T18:49:42.670Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Once lived a time I thought myself in control, as though I understood well enough. At some point a poison arrived, through unnatural means. Cold, horrid, and I certainly don't understand. It's been difficult, but really more than difficult, it etched my soul.","2025-12-16T16:25:42.415Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Good morning! I want Pete Hegseth imprisoned for murder! Have a great day!","2025-11-29T13:35:14.305Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Bluesky desperately needs the ability to create a poll. Let's do it this way: Trump again, after the press conference, said it's a Dem hoax. America, yes or no, is it a hoax?","2025-09-03T16:34:55.281Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Yikes? So I says to myself, go ahead, live on a sailboat on Chesapeake Bay, it'll be fun. Here's to hoping she misses the islands and East Coast and harms no one.🫰","2025-08-14T17:01:18.000Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Trump and his band of misfits would do well to know that every day is No Kings Day.","2025-06-15T18:35:12.037Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Good morning. I really miss the days when waking would rescue me from the nightmare.","2025-04-06T14:39:56.765Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Real quick before my head combusts and I can no longer type... GET TRUMP THE HELL OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE!","2025-02-28T19:26:19.251Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","King Trump claims Ukraine started the war with Russia. Have we arrived yet at the entirely numb location their plan hopes we'll find? We have not yet begun to fight. Why haven't we? It's time we do.","2025-02-21T17:34:56.669Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","When I was a kid, had I known this was coming, it's possible I wouldn't have bothered looking both ways before crossing the street.","2025-02-19T17:50:53.794Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","When I think of all those that have come before us. Those that built and sacrificed for America. For it all to end this way. ...I'm glad I can't hear them. Far too painful. They would be right and their pain real. No end. We fight. For them. For us. For America.","2025-02-18T18:20:36.184Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Well now, have you noticed how the pathetic less thans, maga, no longer wear the red hats? Of course, it's who they are. Vote for a demon as a result of their maga flaws, destroy America, possibly the world, then take no responsibility. Sound familiar? Put the hats on cretins. America insists.","2025-02-16T18:15:42.859Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Well, NOAA going bye-bye huh? Living on a sailboat, having hurricane reports was handy. Even life-saving? Perhaps I can call Trump and ask him and his Sharpie if there are any hurricanes.","2025-02-15T18:09:44.277Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Having trouble writing on Bluesky lately as I simply refuse to curse on Bluesky.","2025-02-14T19:25:34.883Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Trump is a primitive creature. In his thinking, actions. One foot still in the cave. His supporters pathetic and deluded. All living close to primal instinct and far from the thinking mind. Entirely tragic this. Shake off the fear, lean into it, and fight like hell. We will prevail.","2025-02-07T04:09:33.816Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Hey Google, is it normal to go to sleep in America and wake up in 1930's Germany?","2025-01-21T02:46:33.158Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Trying really hard to think of what else might feel like this. The repulsive voice. Again. A selfish twisted face, poisoned and evident. The daily incremental increase of his dark madness. The not knowing if or when it will end. Seemingly limitless. ...there is nothing else that feels like this.","2025-01-09T02:21:32.605Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Convince me these unending follows aren't Elmo attempting to disrupt bluesky.","2025-01-07T15:27:39.641Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","I really admire squirrels. So happy, just being. No politics. Lying president. They're not gravely disappointed voters! Violently deflated!! Their existence mangled indescribably!!! Noo, never squirrels, little bastards, smiling & flitting abo.. Whoa! Dude... Squirrels? 4 yrs pal, pace yourself.","2025-01-07T00:58:51.575Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Bluesky rocks. Starter packs. What a great idea. An honor to be included.","2025-01-05T18:28:43.267Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","...Yeah, my Christmas was ok I guess. Instead of a tree, I went with a stick. And stood in the front yard waving it screaming at passing cars, WHO THE HELL DID YOU VOTE FOR CITIZEN?!!! Anyway... Happy New Year!?","2024-12-31T21:28:42.569Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","I'm gonna invite Felon Musk for New Year's. Finally someone with enough intelligence to drink the remaining beer in bottles with cigarette butts.","2024-12-30T18:41:31.260Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","America now has 50 states of altered consciousness. P.S. This drug sucks.","2024-12-29T18:52:55.833Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","I've heard felon musk is desirous of becoming a trillionaire. With a trillion bucks, he could spend 1 million every day, for 2,738 years. With the 454 billion he has now, he could spend 1 million a day, but only for 1,241 years. Yes, I can see how that could be a burden and explains wanting more.","2024-12-28T02:30:23.039Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","On this Christmas Eve I'm thankful for so many things. Being limited to 300 characters, I'll just mention the one at the top of the list. I am not maga. If ever there were something to be forever grateful for, it's that. We are something better, and therein, lies the strength. Merry Christmas!","2024-12-24T21:52:44.754Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","I'm pretty sure if I mounted this guy at the top of my mast the birds would no longer gather to poop on my deck.","2024-12-18T00:10:46.409Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","I would imagine being outside America and looking this way is a lot like witnessing a car accident. And then they pull the two cars some distance apart so they can do it again.","2024-12-17T16:23:04.497Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","You doing ok America? Surely you jest.","2024-12-14T21:40:17.683Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","First, they wouldn't replace my phone. Finally sent me a replacement, not 1, but 2 identical phones. Which I thought was incredibly stupid, until I realized that with 2 phones there's always someone immediately available for phone sex. Soo... What are you wearing? I feel like I know you already.","2024-12-13T21:22:19.843Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","Trump. The quality of his poison perfected, so fully and completely destructive. His supporters addicted and wanting more. The best solution for this, is for this to have never happened. There is no requirement for a presidential candidate to undergo a psych eval. Think about that, as we spin.","2024-12-12T17:51:06.207Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","I'd use two cups and a string before I'd ever use musks starlink.","2024-12-10T16:28:40.579Z"

"toweather.bsky.social","And to think we were worried about a zombie apocalypse...","2024-11-27T19:23:20.632Z"
"toweather.bsky.social","This is the way the world ends. Well.. Seeing as complete and total destruction will be something of a burden, we should be granted at least one request. That being that the sole survivor be maga and in the smoldering wreakage they find a perfectly unharmed carton of really expensive eggs.","2024-11-26T19:59:24.165Z"

"toweather.bsky.social","If they take SS away I won't be too concerned. I do after all, have a plan. And that would be, live in the woods licking trees for nutrients until such time I can think of a way to off myself with a stick.","2024-11-24T16:41:55.108Z"

"toweather.bsky.social","I'm going to write a song about Marjorie Taylor Greene. I think I'll call it 'yes I can prove I'm human, why do you ask?' It'll be a simple song, no musical instruments, just a lawn mower droning on for 30 minutes. Like Marge, it'll make no sense.","2024-11-18T18:50:44.006Z"

"toweather.bsky.social","What should we talk about? Not politics.. I know, dating, let's talk about dating. Dating sucks. I've always thought dating to be a lot like going to the dentist, while there isn't the sound of the drill, there is still of course the drooling and screaming in agony. P.S. I'm available.","2024-11-17T17:31:45.823Z"
