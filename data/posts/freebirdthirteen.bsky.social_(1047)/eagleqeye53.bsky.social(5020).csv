"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","31/ This April 23 press release is interesting because it suggests no warrant was shown, and the judge was worried about the court being used as an ICE holding facility—which usage would chill litigants from appearing for court, which would lead to a _massive_ uptick in _unnecessary_ bench warrants.","2025-04-25T15:56:07.532Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","30/ So I've seen nothing about this case thus far to disabuse me of the notion that this situation was both explicitly and deliberately created by the federal executive branch, that being the Trump Administration, with the full foreknowledge that it would result in a constitutional crisis like this.","2025-04-25T15:51:34.690Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","29/ The right venue for an immigration seizure would be _outside_ a courthouse.

"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","28/ I've been in a courthouse—albeit only once in 10 years practicing law—when immigration officials arrived _outside_ the context of having already put a hold on someone in custody.

"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","27/ The requirement of separation of powers—which applies to federal/state judges and federal/state law enforcement—makes it essential the judiciary has control over courthouses.

"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","25/ Note that the question here isn't whether a judge can prohibit the execution of an administrative warrant anywhere in the country. It's whether the judge is obligated to allow execution of such a warrant in her courtroom or courthouse, given the obvious risk of confusion and disorder and danger.","2025-04-25T15:41:42.842Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","24/ The now-deleted Patel tweet accused Judge Dugan of creating a danger to public safety, which suggests to me—under the now-traditional """"Every Accusation Is a Confession"""" maxim that applies to all MAGAs—that he _knows_ ICE agents were creating a public safety risk Dugan was trying to avoid.","2025-04-25T15:35:10.972Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","23/ And the latter situation is almost prohibitively unlikely. I've little doubt that if America had an actual Attorney General who wasn't simply a Trump lawyer, and an actual FBI director who wasn't simply _another_ Trump lawyer, the kibosh would already have been put on this entire investigation.","2025-04-25T15:31:49.410Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","21/ They're low for a reason. As a judge has many legitimate bases for not wanting our courts to become ICE staging areas—for both safety reasons and separation of powers reasons—there's simply no _necessity_ for a judge to develop an eldritch specific criminal intent to assist undocumented persons.","2025-04-25T15:28:24.888Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","20/ I agree with the lawyers quoted in the report who say that if there were evidence Judge Dugan had the specific intent—in taking the actions she took—of assisting a litigant in evading arrest, that'd be problematic. I can also say that the chances the FBI has any such evidence are relatively low.","2025-04-25T15:25:57.618Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","19/ This article from the chief paper in Milwaukee offers critical details about exactly what happened, and appears to confirm that the actions by Judge Dugan were most likely intended to prevent a potentially chaotic and dangerous situation from unfolding in her courthouse.","2025-04-25T15:24:24.330Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","17/ Of course, federal law enforcement under Trump is just an extension of his political op, so the purpose of this arrest may simply be to find a judge who's either non-white or a woman or both and then accuse her of doing exactly what Trump voters preposterously believe all judges have been doing.","2025-04-25T15:18:27.250Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","16/ The one thing you can be reasonably confident of—given the cultural conservatism endemic to state and federal judiciaries—is that we're not going to find that Judge Dugan was engaged in a clandestine, cloak-and-dagger conspiracy to aid and abet criminal activity. That's rather silly on its face.","2025-04-25T15:17:10.052Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","15/ That fact raises significantly the likelihood that this arrest, or more generally an arrest _like_ this arrest, was long desired by the Trump Administration, and planned by it, as a way of scaring judges across the country into bending the knee to the federal executive branch. That's horrifying.","2025-04-25T15:14:57.534Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","14/ So my first concern—as an attorney watching this constitutional crisis unfold—is that it's very likely Trump and Patel have in effect manufactured _both_ the public safety danger Judge Dugan was responding to _and_ a separate constitutional danger she was trying to avoid, as well as this crisis.","2025-04-25T15:13:42.787Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","13/ Under separation of powers, judges aren't supposed to coordinate with federal law enforcement to use _one_ case—whether civil or criminal—to advance _a wholly separate immigration case_ that isn't before the judge in question. That'd be improper. It's also what the Trumpists have tried to do.","2025-04-25T15:11:53.691Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","12/ There have been persistent allegations that the federal executive branch under Donald Trump and Kash Patel has attempted to use the judiciary as an unwitting co-conspirator... by using scheduled hearings as traps for undocumented persons. Judges have a responsibility not to play ball with this.","2025-04-25T15:09:15.692Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","11/ I want to underscore, as someone who practiced law as a trial attorney across many jurisdictions and courthouses, that maintaining the safety of the courthouses is one of the jobs of the judges in each courthouse. It is also critical that judges not be seen to participate in executive functions.","2025-04-25T15:07:50.593Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","10/ Keep in mind that Patel—the most lawless FBI director in agency history—only took about 60 days on the job to arrest a judge for actions she took in her own courthouse. Those of us who have been saying that Trump is moving toward autocracy at blinding speed should repeat that admonition today.","2025-04-25T15:05:50.900Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","9/ As you can see, we don't yet have anything on this story besides what I've already recounted. I'm linking here to the current version of the ABC News breaking news report, which merely reiterates what Patel posted.","2025-04-25T15:02:25.404Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","8/ It is worth every American thinking of that 2024 case today, as whether you agree with it or not we can all remember that Trump insisted federal officials shouldn't be arrested if in the conduct of their duties. So the bar is insanely high for Patel to show that Dugan was acting outside her role.","2025-04-25T15:00:16.582Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","7/ Just as member of Congress are protected from being arrested in the exercise of legitimate duties, judges are supposed to be protected from arrest for doing anything in the proper ambit of their jobs, a less dramatic version of the veritable kingship SCOTUS gave Trump in _Trump v. United States_.","2025-04-25T14:58:39.793Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","6/ We also know that while judges can of course commit crimes and are subject to the same criminal statutes as the rest of us, the one thing federal law enforcement has always made sure that it did _not_ do was arrest judges who are in the midst of doing their jobs. _That_ is what creates a crisis.","2025-04-25T14:56:06.468Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","5/ We don't yet know if this is the case. What we know is that Patel has been looking to arrest a judge in a way related to immigration as a way of terrorizing the entire judiciary in the United States—state and federal—into doing Trump's bidding with respect to his illegal mass deportation scheme.","2025-04-25T14:54:42.070Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","4/ Kash Patel has co-orchestrated these improper seizures that have terrified courthouse-goers across the nation. If this arrest was made of a judge who allowed a litigant an alternative exit from the building to ensure proper order and safety inside her courthouse, this crisis was created by Patel.","2025-04-25T14:53:31.258Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","3/ Data is still trickling out about this arrest, but I wanted to give this background so readers would understand the unprecedented situation judges have been placed in in trying to ensure that ICE seizures being done improperly—possibly as a ruse by vigilantes—do not happen in their courthouses.","2025-04-25T14:51:58.139Z"
"eagleqeye53.bsky.social","2/ This was presenting judges with extremely dangerous situations in their courthouse lobbies—with people who could be vigilantes kidnapping persons appearing before the court in such a terrifying, unusual and illegal way that it could lead to a riot among on-site witnesses trying to protect others.","2025-04-25T14:50:33.222Z"
