"ashlove7.bsky.social","Demartravion “Trey” Reed was found hanging from a tree yesterday at Delta State University. He was obviously lynched! Say his name! Also, Trump is ordering information about slavery to be removed at national parks. There needs to more outrage about this.","2025-09-16T12:46:57.284Z"
"ashlove7.bsky.social","I’ve been very quiet on BlueSky the past few days. Let’s just say I’m tired of all the racism. As a Black woman in America, I’m exhausted. All the gaslighting towards marginalized communities the past few days have been off the rails!","2025-09-14T19:11:42.886Z"
"ashlove7.bsky.social","I’m so excited! Tonight, Catelin Drey(a Democrat), won the special Senate election for District 1 in Iowa!!! Iowa!! A red state and super red district! Wow! Maybe the tides are starting to turn!! I feel more hopeful now. I’m feeling so grateful💙💙","2025-08-27T02:58:53.682Z"

"ashlove7.bsky.social","For all those rightwingers crying about how “DeMoCrAtS GerRyMaNdEr ToO,” just ask them if they support a nationwide ban on gerrymandering. We do. They don’t. They’re not mad at the concept of gerrymandering, they’re mad that they don’t get to be the only party wielding it anymore.","2025-08-05T03:43:12.834Z"
"ashlove7.bsky.social","Until we pass a nationwide ban on gerrymandering (which we need), Democrats should gerrymander every state to the fullest extent. 52-0 in CA, 17-0 in IL, and so on. No more unilateral disarmament. Time to get serious about fighting back.","2025-08-05T03:47:53.064Z"

"ashlove7.bsky.social","Hey everyone! Sorry I haven’t posted in almost a couple of weeks. Boy this whole Epstein thing is crazy! Trump is trying so hard to distract us, but the Epstein conversation isn’t going away anytime soon.","2025-07-22T13:37:17.013Z"
"ashlove7.bsky.social","WTF?!? Border Czar Tom Homan claimed that ICE and Border Patrol agents don’t need probable cause to detain people they suspect are undocumented, saying they can do so based on factors like physical appearance. This is straight-up racial profiling, not law enforcement.","2025-07-11T19:36:59.391Z"
"ashlove7.bsky.social","We shouldn't need a Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, but here we are. Still underpaid. Still undervalued. 66 cents on the dollar means we lose thousands every year, for doing the same job. Over a lifetime? That’s hundreds of thousands gone. Pay Black women.

"ashlove7.bsky.social","I’ve been a little critical of how little many Dems seemed to be fighting for our country, but I’ve got to say, thank you to Leader Jeffries for fighting back and clearly telling the American people what is in this bill. At least he tried to do something even if this Big Ugly Bill gets passed.","2025-07-03T16:15:40.463Z"
