"noeverythingsfine.bsky.social","Trump makes the US more hated than any President ever. He orders random military attacks. Our former allies know they can't trust us. Our enemies know they can bribe Trump & he'll sell the US out. We're alone & getting weaker daily. Does it even matter if Trump realizes he's a Russian asset?","2026-01-04T03:20:55.718Z"

"noeverythingsfine.bsky.social","This guy wanted a selfie holding his Russian (Irkutsk, S.E. Siberian) flag in front of Congress. The US was in day 7 of our shutdown. He seemed delighted. Maybe he thinks Russians own us now. I can’t say he’s wrong.","2025-10-11T19:26:10.965Z"

"noeverythingsfine.bsky.social","The National Guard Trump’s abusing didn’t sign up for this. I met these two nice kids from Mississippi.

"noeverythingsfine.bsky.social","US laws, taxes, subsidies & tariffs indirectly control the whole economy: how much you earn & keep; how much everything costs. Since WWII, US economic system was the most transparent, stable & fair in the world. Everyone trusted & wanted US $.","2025-10-06T22:16:50.682Z"
"noeverythingsfine.bsky.social","Wonder why Trump hates comedians? Logical arguments mostly reinforce existing beliefs. Even the strongest ones just trigger emotions, which are faster than analysis in human brains. So it gets blocked without ever getting analyzed. But comedy IS emotional. “Dangerous” ideas and facts can sneak in.","2025-10-04T14:53:31.829Z"

"noeverythingsfine.bsky.social","DC is almost empty. You can stand in streets that should be busy. Trump’s tariffs, threats, ICE, and unwanted troops are bad for the only thing he really cares about: business. Or profits.","2025-10-03T17:42:40.216Z"
"noeverythingsfine.bsky.social","How should a free citizen respond to this? Two National Guard troops ordered to stand in DC Metro at the Federal Triangle station.

"noeverythingsfine.bsky.social","The US must choose $ or democracy. Money is not free speech, when $ kill good ideas. Corporations are not people, when they’ll do any immoral thing to turn a profit.

"noeverythingsfine.bsky.social","FAFO. But most of the time, Trump’s Team Taco gets stopped by the courts. So the low-info MAGAts don’t find out. I’m afraid we’ll be worse off if he toddles on like this for four years, than if we don’t stop him, and just let his shit really hit the fan.
