"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/2 There's so damn much to unpack in these 2 short minutes, about the vernacular """"Jew of color,"""" about young Iranian activists in Iran... You should watch this. And rest assured, I plan to have @matthewnouriel.bsky.social again to talk about Iran!","2025-03-30T23:36:55.692Z"

"boazhepner.bsky.social","Abraham Hamra does not feel the need to say the right thing just to placate people. He's loud, he's proud, and he's totally worth watching. Can't wait for more episodes with him! Full episode with Abraham and everyone: youtu.be/a8BUIfmya9w @matthewnouriel.bsky.social","2025-03-26T00:20:31.865Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/2 When I asked Jenny Cohen if she would be on my episode with other """"Jews of Color,"""" she was genuinely conflicted. Yes she has always seen herself that way, as a Mexican Jew in America, but as her skin is white, she often gets dismissed when the topic arises, both from outsiders and from within.","2025-03-23T18:23:16.486Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/2 Episode 11 is here! This one was fun, insightful, and full of diverse perspectives. I sat down with 14 Jewish men and women from different racial and ethnic backgrounds—along with Nate Looney—to talk about their lived experiences. The resulting conversation was epic. youtu.be/a8BUIfmya9w","2025-03-18T03:24:14.117Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/2 This is a cool and fun honor. I've been asked by Congregation Or Ami to be a guest speaker at their Affinity event, and discuss my efforts with gathering varieties of people on my show. It will be on Thursday, March 27th at 7pm on Zoom.","2025-03-14T18:43:48.093Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/2 I must thank my co-moderator Nate for this introduction, because @aprilpowerstv.bsky.social adds important nuance to our conversation. Her professional and personal experiences make her how I want to finish off this wonderful episode where I was able to have this conversation with Black Jews.","2025-03-13T18:06:51.682Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","My friend Rachel Moon has given me the pleasure of her company as a guest on 2 different episodes! She really impresses me with her capability to brush off the haters. People say racist things to her, they say antisemitic things to her, and she does NOT let it bother her. What's the secret sauce?","2025-03-12T23:43:36.988Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/2 You want to hear a POWERFUL VOICE? Every word I've heard from @eli7chicnsweet.bsky.social during and since this episode, comes from a place of passion, something many of us are lacking.","2025-03-11T19:20:44.120Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","I had a phenomenal conversation with these seven Black Jews and my co-moderator Nate Looney. First question was actually, do you even LIKE that label in the first place, and unsurprisingly, their answers were varied. youtu.be/yeQj5hokdz0 @aprilpowerstv.bsky.social @eli7chicnsweet.bsky.social","2025-02-14T18:06:55.822Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/2 Please DM me any questions you have for this next episode I'll be filming in a week. We are doing a deep dive into the bias @wikipedia.org has been blatantly showing against Israel and so many things.","2025-02-12T22:29:26.551Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","Please DON'T turn this into a pity party for me. I'll be fine. It's those who have suffered these great losses who I write this for. Send them letters and care packages and money. Check up on them, not me. Thank you.","2025-01-16T04:17:21.509Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/3 So apparently what happened to me on Shabbat is technically called a """"hate incident,"""" not to be confused with a """"hate crime."""" I have literally no idea if Waymo is going to do a thing about it, but I reported it to them immediately after Shabbat. And we all know they have cameras up the wazoo.","2025-01-14T05:13:26.195Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/2 This happened to me today. While the city I love is in flames, and people I know have lost their homes or are evacuated unsure if there will be a home to return to. It's supposed to be my """"Day of Rest,"""" but instead I was full of anxious energy for the next few hours.","2025-01-12T04:58:45.621Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/5 Are we okay? How to answer that. I'm in Santa Monica at Saint John's today, a hell of a first day back after helping Adi at home for 2 months with her broken back, and it's just depressing finding out how many people have lost their homes here.","2025-01-09T20:56:05.148Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","1/ David Bowie sang, """"We can be heroes, just for one day."""" But imagine being a hero every day. For an act that costs you no money, and just a little time. Organ donation. It's something we don't think about enough, but why? youtu.be/r2n5qLVz0rM","2024-12-31T22:10:31.741Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","These posters make me really smile. Knowing I'm going to get to spend a few hours talking to each of these fascinating people with Nate Looney, as always going through the serious topics that need to be discussed, but always having some laughs. It's epic.","2024-12-27T22:09:49.819Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","This app won't let me post anything over 60 seconds. That's way too limiting. So unless the rules change I'll just be sharing the full episodes and posters here, and none of the reels I create (such as the screenshot of my Instagram). Frustrating.

"boazhepner.bsky.social","The next episode I'm lucky enough to record will be my second one with my trusted friend Nate Looney talking to these amazing Black Jews about their experiences as such - both positive and negative. Please send me your questions by Thanksgiving! And remember it's released a month or so later!","2024-11-27T00:33:22.127Z"
"boazhepner.bsky.social","Guess I won't be able to post my reels here after all, because there's a 60 second limit. So ixnay on that whole idea to test out. But I'll still at least post my episodes.
